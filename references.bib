   abstract = {Water is an essential component of all forms of life and is one of the most important natural resources on planet Earth. Wastewater refers to stormwater and urban runoff and includes all effluents (sewage or liquid waste) coming from institutions, hospitals, industries, households, etc. Thus wastewater is contaminated by many toxic substances that have been proven to be harmful to living organisms and hence needs to be treated before being released into the environment. The major goal of wastewater treatment is to minimize the load of harmful compounds prior to the discharge of water back into the environment. Such an approach requires restoration of the water supply and protection of the planet from the hazardous effects of toxins. Insufficient or improper wastewater treatment can have adverse environmental consequences and subsequently cause harm to aquatic and wildlife, and can eventually lead to contamination of drinking water. The composition of wastewater varies widely depending on the source and therefore different treatment strategies are applied. The majority of wastewater treatment methods can be categorized into two main groups: biological treatment and chemical/physical treatment. The first technique utilizes biological material and/or bacteria, and the second is based on physical processes or chemical reactions. This chapter provides a brief description of the types of wastewater and their properties as well as presents an overview of wastewater treatment methods including sedimentation, coagulation, solvent extraction, and biological treatment.},

   abstract = {Drying constitutes an important process for wastewater sludge management, as it can reduce the mass and the volume of the product and consequently the cost of storage, handling and transport. During constant operating conditions, the drying kinetic of the sludge has shown mainly: a constant drying rate, one or two falling rate periods and a final short period with variations along the process of the physical properties of the product with the appearance of shrinkage and cracks phenomena. Solar drying was benefit as using free solar energy can reduce the cost of the operation. On the other hand, it plays an important role for the pathogen reduction until Environmental protection Agency (EPA) recommendations. In some studied cases, the value of 1000CFUg−1 DS, which represents the EPA Class A pathogen requirement, for fecal coliform was attained. The general design of used solar dryers was constituted of: a greenhouse made with transparent material and a floor, where the product is speared in thick layers. Furthermore, fans and ventilations can be used in order to have homogeneous distribution of the air inside the greenhouse with replacement of humidified air with fresh one. Automatic or handle mix of the product was used once or for several times a day. In order to increase the performances of the drying system, other ways such as heating the floor using solar water heater, infrared lamps, using heat pumps or adding thermal energy storage systems were also tested. Covered solar drying has given better results than open solar drying. However, the origin of the wastewater sludge affects the obtained results. Alternatively, modeling drying systems was effectuated using heat and mass balances, applied for the air and the dried product. Solar drying of wastewater sludge has given satisfactory results.},

   abstract = {Oil and grease (O&G) is a class of pollutants with very low affinity to water. Their removal from wastewaters is often challenging and involves the combination of different treatment technologies, according to the specifications for the treated water and the O&G substances involved. O&G can be classified according to its type and source and this influences the choice of the treatment process. This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art technology on O&G removal. Treatment usually involves several steps, including primary, secondary and tertiary treatment. Gravity separators accomplish removal of free oil as a primary treatment. Secondary treatments include chemical, electrical and physical methods which target emulsified oil, such as, coagulation/flocculation, dissolved air flotation, electro-coagulation/flotation, and membrane separation. Tighter membranes and advanced oxidation processes can refine treatment in a tertiary step. Many of these treatments present, however, disadvantages such as production of hazardous sludge or high energy requirements. In this context, sorption as a secondary treatment is gaining focus in the literature, especially using natural organic sorbents. These present the advantages of lower cost and biodegradability, and may enable the recovery or recycling of sorbed O&G. Additionally, some of them may be reused up to a limited number of working cycles. Several kinds of sorbents and mechanisms for oil sorption and recovery are reviewed in this article.},

Activated sludges are generally hard to dewater, and the design and the control of the separation operations are often quite difficult. In order to better understand this problem, pertinent indices are needed. The knowledge of how water is distributed within activated sludge is an interesting approach. Current literature dealing with this topic is, however, relatively difficult to apply. This work presents a review of the problem of moisture distribution classification and measurement within activated sludge. The main techniques used for this analysis are compared and discussed in detail. The estimation of the water binding energy is also extremely commented upon. Finally, the paper discusses the utility of this type of analysis to examine the conditioning and dewatering of activated sludge.},

However, compositions and thermal degradation behaviours of sludge were highly complex and distinctive compared to other traditional feedstock led to a need of fundamental research on sludge. Comprehensive characterisation of sludge specifically for thermochemical conversion was carried out for all existing Water Reclamation Plants in Singapore. In total, 14 sludge samples collected based on the type, plant, and batch categorisation. Existing characterisation methods for physical and chemical properties were analysed and reviewed using the collected samples. Qualitative similarities and quantitative variations of different sludge samples were identified and discussed. Oxidation of inorganic in sludge during ash forming analysis found to be causing significant deviations on proximate and ultimate analysis. Therefore, alternative parameters and comparison basis including Fixed Residues (FR), Inorganic Matters (IM) and Total Inorganics (TI) were proposed for better understanding on the thermochemical characteristics of sludge.}

   abstract = {After a ban on the depositing of untreated sludge in landfills, the sludge from municipal and industrial water-treatment plants can be regarded as a problem. Waste products of the water treatment process can be a problem or an opportunity - a source for obtaining raw materials. In the European Union, raw sludge and fats, oil and grease (FOG) from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) cannot be deposited in any natural or controlled environment. For this reason, it must be processed (stabilized, dried) to be used later as a fertilizer, building material, or alternative fuel source suitable for co-incineration in high temperature furnaces (power plants or concrete plants). The processes of drying sludge, where heat and electricity are used, are energy consuming and economically unattractive. Beside energy efficiency, the main problem of sludge drying is in its variability of quality as a raw material. In addition to this, sludge can be contaminated by a number of organic and inorganic pollutants and organisms. Due to the presence or absence of pollutants, different end products can be economically interesting. For example, if the dried sludge contains coliform bacteria, viruses, helminths eggs or smaller quantities of heavy metals, it cannot be used as a fertilizer but can still be used as a fuel. The objectives of the current article is to present a batch-processing pilot device of sludge or digestate that allows the following: (1) low pressure and low temperature energy effective drying of from 10 to 40% remaining water content, (2) disinfection of pathogen (micro)organisms, (3) heavy metal reduction, (4) production of products of predetermined quality (e.g. containing different quantities of water; it can be used as a fertilizer, or if the percentage of water in the dry sludge is decreased to 10%, then the dried sludge can be used as a fuel with a calorific value similar to coal). An important feature is also the utilization of low-pressure technology to prevent odorous gasses from spreading into the environment. There are presented two new technologies: a) Sewage sludge or digestate drying in the vacuum chamber consumes approx. 1 kWh/dm3 of evaporated water and, therefore, reaches a price of 180–240 Euros/t Dry Matter (DM), and b) Heavy metals' reduction using adsorbing reaction with magnetite nanostructures can decrease the level of heavy metals in the sewage sludge or digestate up to 20% in one cycle, which can be repeated several times on the same sludge. The aim of the paper is to present a newly developed technology which can provide economic and safe use of moderate heavy metals polluted sewage sludge on agricultural lands as organic fertilizer and, therefore, returning the nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium) back to the human food chain, instead of being incinerated or landfilled. The proposed drying technology is economically sustainable due to the low vacuum and temperature (35 °C–40 °C), that increases the efficiency of the heat pump (coefficient of performance 5–7,2) of the energy produced by the anaerobic digestion. Hence, the main emphasis is given to the development of: an efficient method for heavy metals' reduction in the sludge treatment chain by using chitosan covered magnetite nanoparticles, an efficient drying method in a vacuum with low temperature energy which can be exploited from sludge digestion to reduce organic matter, and an energy sustainable concept of sludge treatment, with the addition of fats, oil and grease (FOG) to produce enough biogas for sludge drying to produce fertilizer.},

The chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and turbidity measurements were used to evaluate the water quality. It was noted that the chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand readings had significantly decreased on days 11 and 21 of treatment. Thus, the observed data confirm M. aquatica as a potential replacement for current wastewater treatment methods.},

Sewage sludge (mainly composed of excessive bio-sludge) is an inevitable by-product of biological wastewater treatment process and contains various toxic substances, such as pathogens, heavy metals, and organic contaminants. The production of sewage sludge may cause serious pollution risks without appropriate disposals. As the essential step of sludge treatment, dewatering plays significant roles in minimizing the sludge volume, facilitating the transportation, increasing the calorific value and even reducing the leachate production in landfill sites. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the issues related to dewatering of sewage sludge. Section 1 starts with the environmental implications of sludge dewatering. Section 2 deals with the concepts and challenges about differentiation of bound water fractions, and also reviews the recent progress of in-situ visualization of water occurrence states in bio-flocs. Section 3 discusses about how various physiochemical properties influence the sludge dewaterability, and the insufficiency in in-situ micro-characterization of sludge constituents is pointed out. Section 4 reviews the existing conditioning technologies for sludge dewaterability improvement, and the advantages/disadvantages of each technology in terms of applicable occasions, material consumption, energy consumption and environmental impacts are evaluated. The last section (section 5) specifically analyzes the feasibility of integrating sludge dewatering and re-utilization, and raises attention to the potential environmental risks of dewatering conditioning. Based on the above discussion, we propose that a unified theory for sludge dewaterability improvement remains to be established. Especially, how the molecular structures of sludge compositions affect the solid-water interface behavior requires to be deepened, which will further unravel the mechanism behind strong water-holding capacities of bio-flocs. Additionally, we believe that the key challenges for sludge dewatering is how to select the appropriate conditioning technique according to the physiochemical properties of target sludge. The reliable indicators for real-time control of conditioning operations are still deficient, e.g., dynamic dosage control of conditioning chemicals. Accordingly, the potential environmental risks of excessive conditioning chemicals should be taken into more consideration.},

   abstract = {In the current review paper, various issues related to the combustion of sewage sludge are discussed. After briefly explaining the formation and treatment of sewage sludge, current and future sludge production are discussed. Thereafter, the four sludge disposal methods which are currently used, i.e. recycling in agriculture, landfilling, dumping into sea and incineration, are examined, and the future trend presented showing the increasing role of sludge incineration. Thereafter, technologies for thermal processing of sewage sludge are presented. They are discussed in three groups, i.e. mono-combustion, co-combustion and alternative processes. Various mono-combustion incinerators, including multiple hearth, fluidized bed and smelting furnaces are briefly discussed, whereas for co-combustion, attention has been given to co-combustion with coals in pulverized and fluidized bed coal combustors, as well as co-incineration with municipal solid wastes in various furnaces. Where possible, data from large scale plants are presented. Currently being discussed in the sludge disposal cycles are the alternative thermal processes to sludge combustion. These include wet oxidation, pyrolysis, oil from sludge processes, and combinations of pyrolysis, combustion and gasification processes. Some of these alternative technologies are also briefly discussed. An important aspect during thermal processing of sewage sludge is its combustion mechanisms. Compared to coals, sewage sludge has very high contents of moisture and volatile matter which can affect the combustion process. The importance of the drying and devolatilization processes for sewage sludge combustion is thus examined. In a special case, the release and combustion of the volatiles during sludge combustion in fluidized bed combustors is analysed, and some information concerning the combustion of sludge char is presented. Another important issue of sludge combustion is the emissions of pollutants gases as well as the handling of solid by-products. Of concern include the heavy metals, mercury, dioxins and furans, acid gases, as well as NOx and N2O. These are also briefly discussed. A peculiar characteristic of sewage sludge is its high content of nitrogen, and attention has been given to see how this affects the N2O and NOx emissions.

   abstract = {With increasing water scarcity, reuse of water is becoming increasingly more attractive. Moreover, in large parts of the world centralized sewerage is still not available. In this paper we discuss a solution for treatment and reuse of source segregated domestic wastewater. The blackwater fraction is treated in an evapotranspiration tank (TEvap) system, whereas the greywater fraction is treated by a compact setup including a grease trap, sedimentation tank and two constructed wetlands. Results of both systems, obtained during a 400-days trial in a 9-person household in Campo Grande-MS, Brazil, are presented. Results show that it is possible to introduce an ecological and low-cost alternative to conventional septic tank solutions, to manage both greywater and blackwater at household level, enabling the development of green areas, improving microclimate and allowing for the reuse of grey water and the nutrients present in black water. The TEvap system was essentially maintenance free, but the constructed wetlands did require attention, to prevent clogging of subsystems.},

   abstract = {The composition of grey wastewater depends on sources and installations from where the water is drawn, e.g. kitchen, bathroom or laundry. The chemical compounds present originate from household chemicals, cooking, washing and the piping. In general grey wastewater contains lower levels of organic matter and nutrients compared to ordinary wastewater, since urine, faeces and toilet paper are not included. The levels of heavy metals are however in the same concentration range. The information regarding the content of xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs) is limited. From this study, 900 different XOCs were identified as potentially present in grey wastewater by the use of tables of contents of household chemical products.},
