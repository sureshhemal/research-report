This study aims to assess the performance evaluation of a \ac{WWTP} located at Moratuwa/ Ratmalana during a selected period in 2023. Data were collected based on the physiochemical parameters such as pH and temperature, as well as chemical parameters including \ac{BOD}, \ac{COD}, \ac{TSS}, \ac{OG}, Ortho-Phosphate (Dissolved Phosphate), and Fluoride from the inlet and outlet. Under sludge management, sludge samples were collected from the sludge storage tank, return water and dewatered sludge samples from the belt press and the dried sludge samples from the drying bed to test for the \ac{TSS}, moisture content, solid content, and \ac{SVMC}.

This study was conducted to accomplish several objectives, such as evaluate the effluent quality based on the standards issued by \ac{CEA}, Sri Lanka, evaluate the efficiencies of removing contaminants through the biological treatment process, evaluate the belt press efficiency and analysis of the sludge drying process and moisture removal percentage.

The performance evaluation presents the following removal efficiencies; 93.55\% of \ac{BOD}, 86.95\% of \ac{COD}, 95.28\% of \ac{TSS}, 97.04\% of \ac{OG}, 79.08\% of ortho-phosphate, and 68.04\% of Fluoride.  This study also investigated the efficiency of the belt press dewatering process under two criteria and the moisture removal percentages during the drying period.  It was revealed that the study findings can be used to identify and fix operating and maintenance issues and plan future plant expansions to accommodate higher hydraulic and organic loads.
